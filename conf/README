Use the prelocal.conf and postlocal.conf files to make modifications.  

The prelocal.conf file is read before the global.conf.dist file is processed. Non-local variables in this file
are then available for use in global.conf.dist.

The postlocal.conf file is read after the global.conf.dist file is processed and will overright configurations in global.conf.dist

In order to make sure that the global.conf.dist is read you should remove
(or make unreadable) the global.conf file.  Other wise the global.conf file
will be read instead of global.conf.dist.  

This system should greatly simplify the process of updating webwork2 since it is less likely
that one will need to modify the config files when upgrading.  Default configurations or permissions for 
new features will be defined in global.conf.dist and will allow automatic upgrades.  
Overrides for these new features can be added later to postlocal.conf
