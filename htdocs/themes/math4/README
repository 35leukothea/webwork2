This folder contains the files necessary for the math4 theme.  These files are
tracked by git and any changes made to them will be overwritten when you 
upgrade.  The two exceptions are math4-overrides.css and math4-overrides.js.  
These files can be used to override the standard math4.css and math4.js files 
similar to how localOverrides.conf overrides defaults.conf.  If you upgrade 
your server these files will not change, but their .dist versions may change.  This might cause problems until you merge the changes.
