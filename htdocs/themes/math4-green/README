This is an "alternative" colorization to math4.  If you want to provide 
multiple themes to your users you should follow this as an example.  Everything
should be a link pointing back to math4 (so that it gets updated automatically)
except for the override files, which you will use to actually make your
changes and which will not be overwritten.
