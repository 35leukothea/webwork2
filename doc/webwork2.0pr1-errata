The location of the documentation about what to add to your Apache config is
non-obvious.  It is located in lib/Apache/WeBWorK.pm.

The Apache config documentation is missing the line
	use lib '/opt/webwork/pglib';
which should immediately follow the line
	use lib '/opt/webwork/lib';
	
Line 86 of the file lib/WeBWorK/ContentGenerator/ProblemSet.pm should read
	my $effectiveUser = $cldb->getUser($r->param("effectiveUser"));
